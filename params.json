Globalization Pipeline is a Bluemix service that integrates into the DevOps process to provide machine translation and editing capabilities for web or mobile UIs.\r\n\r\nThis project was designed, developed, and published to PyPI by me. I am also currently responsible for maintaining it.\r\n\r\n### py-botnet\r\nThis is a Python project that simulates a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) via a Botnet. The program synchronizes Bots in a Botnet by using a Coordinator, the Bots then attack the Target Server at the specified time.\r\n\r\nI created this project in order to gain experience with Socket programming.\r\n\r\n### java-clicker-quiz\r\nThis Java project provides a simple Clicker Quiz framework. A Click Quiz usually involves a teacher asking the class a multiple-choice question, followed by the students picking an option on their Clicker devices. The program has a server side (teacher) that listens for clients (students) to connect; once a client connects and is authenticated, it is provided with the options to answer the question, choosing an option sends a response back to the server where it is logged for each id (student number).\r\n\r\nI created this project to gain experience with the Client-Server model while utilizing sockets.",
